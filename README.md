# Roll the Troll

## Description

A DnD old school style text and dice roller game but with a slightly more modern twist.  You have to roll the troll before he rolls you.  The troll likes to use 90s movie references.  There are dice rolls and seperate actions with different waited values.  This game was developed from a previous version I made in Python rewritten from scratch in Vanilla javascript. One of my first forays into game development in javascript.
